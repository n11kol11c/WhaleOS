;                         In progress
; ==============================================================================
;  WhaleOS is an experimental operating system project currently under active
;  construction. The primary intention behind WhaleOS is to explore low-level
;  systems programming concepts while maintaining a clean, minimal, and educational
;  codebase. At this stage, the project should be considered a prototype rather
;  than a finished OS.
;
;  WHAT THIS PROJECT IS:
;  ---------------------
;  • A sandbox for learning kernel development  
;  • A minimalistic and transparent implementation  
;  • A platform where ideas can be tested quickly  
;  • A project that evolves through incremental refinement  
;
;  WHAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT (YET):
;  --------------------------------
;  • Not feature complete  
;  • Not stable  
;  • Not suitable for daily use or production  
;  • Not guaranteed to maintain backwards compatibility  
;
;  Current Status:
;  ----------------
;  WhaleOS is in an early-stage development phase. Core components such as memory
;  management, multitasking, device drivers, and a usable shell are either
;  partially implemented or completely absent. Many subsystems exist only as
;  placeholders or simple demonstrations. The codebase may change dramatically
;  as the architecture matures.
;
;  Design Philosophy:
;  ------------------
;  WhaleOS follows a minimalistic philosophy: implement only what is necessary,
;  keep the design transparent, and avoid unnecessary complexity. This approach
;  makes the project approachable for learners and easier to extend for advanced
;  experimentation. Simplicity is preferred over feature density during early
;  development.
;
;  CONTRIBUTIONS:
;  --------------
;  Contributions, ideas, and constructive feedback are welcome. Because WhaleOS
;  is still being shaped, even small improvements can have a meaningful impact.
;  Expect refactoring and breaking changes as the internal architecture evolves.
;
;  USERS AND READERS:
;  -------------------
;  If you are exploring this project, please keep in mind:
;      • Many components are incomplete  
;      • Behavior may change between commits  
;      • Documentation is still growing  
;      • Bugs are expected  
;
;  Thank you for your interest in WhaleOS.  
;  Whether you are learning, experimenting, or simply curious about OS internals,
;  we hope the project serves as a clear and educational reference.
